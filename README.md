An extension of my Math SL IA, if anyone else wants to study cadaver cooling curves I got your back with this bad boyðŸ’ªðŸ’ª

What am I trying to do? Basically I was working on my math IA, and I realized that it takes a lot of time and work to calculate body cooling curves.
So I thought I'd make a mini calculator so whomever wants to study this for their IA need not suffer (like I did).
